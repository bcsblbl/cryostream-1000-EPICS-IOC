# Cryostream 1000 (EPICS IOC)

## Overview
Cryostream 1000 (Oxford Cryosystems) Driver for EPICS IOC. This is an EPICS stream device driver for the Oxford CryoSystems 1000 Series Cryostream. We used [djvine/OxfordCryo_CryoStream800](https://github.com/djvine/OxfordCryo_CryoStream800) as base code to implement our Cryostream 1000 version of the driver.

We also extended and improved the code of a Cryostream 800 version, please check our [repository](https://github.com/bcsblbl/Cryostream-800-EPICS-IOC).

## Installation and Setup
### Requirements
- CALC: `/opt/epics7/base-7.0.7/modules/synApps_6_2_1/support/calc-R3-7-4`
- ASYN: `/opt/epics7/base-7.0.7/modules/synApps_6_2_1/support/asyn-R4-42/`
- STREAM: `/opt/epics7/base-7.0.7/modules/synApps_6_2_1/support/StreamDevice-2-8-16`
- Set `EPICS_BASE` last: `/opt/epics7/base-7.0.7`

### Installation Tips
- **Tip 00**: Update the file `Configure > Release` with the correct paths (OXCS1000 folder).
- **Tip 01**: Our EPICS base is installed at `/opt/epics7/base-7.0.7`, and the IOCs at `/opt/iocs/CS800/`.
- **Tip 02**: Ensure the `st.cmd` file is executable: `chmod +x st.cmd`
- **Tip 03**: To execute the IOC, run `./st.cmd`.

## Usage
### Basic Commands
- Retrieve variables: `caget OXCRYO:CS1000:DEVICEMINTEMP`
- Start cooling (COOL command): Set the temperature first with `CTEMP`.
- List available commands: Run `./st.cmd` and type `dbl`.
- Update IP settings in the `st.cmd` file as needed.
